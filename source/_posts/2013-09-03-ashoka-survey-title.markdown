At Nilenso, we've helped [Ashoka](http://india.ashoka.org/) accomplish their initiative in building infrastructure for the [citizen sector](https://www.ashoka.org/citizensector). Infiniti, a suite of products designed for social entrepreneurs to enable societal change. It is currently very much in use inside Ashoka around these verticals:

- Nutrition and Wellness – for addressing malnutrition problem among children in India
- Affordable Housing – for enabling access to housing in the informal sector
- Rural Innovation and Farming – to understand the role of women in Agriculture

It allows the fellows at Ashoka and other citizen sector organizations to solicit quality and variety of data through crowd sourcing, organized surveys and market research. Through 'DAI', we aim to help Ashoka fellows and other citizen sector organizations in strategic decision making, and to achieve the right Insights, Interventions & Impact

Infiniti Suite is largely composed of these attributes:

As a part of this, we built Ashoka Survey Web––one of the arms that takes care of data collection, validation and integrity.

The core 

We created a quick one-minute screencast that describes a simple workflow on how a survey is created, how a response is taken on that survey on the web and some basic reports you can see around it.

### Why we needed a custom SB?
We looked at Wufoo, Google Forms, Survey Monkey before deciding to write our hand-rolled Survey Builder.

- No offline mode
- Infinite nesting of questions and sub-questions
- Very targeted question types

### This is what it can do

After identifying the problem and designing a set of questions around it, it's useful to have it digitized quickly.


So, Having designed a questionnaire, one can quickly digitize these questions using the survey builder. We currently have the ability to build these types of questions: [list]

 this how the application actually solves these problems.

- Create surveys
- Collect responses
- Show reports

- Organizations can register themselves
- Surveys can be shared between orgs
- Can be shared publicly

### This is how we built it

### This is what we plan to do next

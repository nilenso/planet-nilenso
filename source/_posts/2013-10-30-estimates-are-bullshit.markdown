Estimates are bullshit. Velocity is data.

_noun_
ˈɛstɪmət/
1. an approximate calculation or judgment of the value, number, quantity, or extent of something.
_synonyms:	rough calculation, approximation, estimation, educated/informed guess, rough guess_



- guessing
  - error margin: smaller guesses vs. bigger guesses
  - client's desire: commitment, not a guess.
    - this desire isn't because our clients are mean or stupid...
      it is because they want to _plan_.
  - we will never eliminate the bullshit of estimate-guessing completely,
    but we can make it as small as possible so the bullshit is easier to digest.

- solution:
  - science! measure. project.
  - what do we measure?
    - smallest piece possible the client can say is "done": story (INVEST)
    - you, the client, need to know we are actually accomplishing something.
  - what duration do we measure?
    - one week, one iteration
    - short enough for movement and re-prioritization
    - long enough to capture meaningful data
    - caveat: if the duration is one week, you need enough weeks to make that data meaningful
  - what can we project?
    - even with one week's data, we can project that velocity forward
    - averaging 2 or 3 weeks accounts for irregularities (vacation, sick days, tech hurdles)

- re-introducing estimates
  - simplify estimation as much as possible (1,2,3)
  - as analysis matures, you will converge on one story size (2)
  - why not start with all stories as 2 and mark the tiny / big outliers?
  - if you can avoid 1's and 3's, why not avoid estimates altogether? (story velocity)

- smells
  - adjusting velocity: "last week was special" / people took vacation / got sick
  - trusting anything but numbers: developers are optimists, owners are hopeful

- compare to building a house: sq ft of drywall, # of shingles
  - even here: people get sick / take vacation, acts of god, blocked dependencies

- more mature solutions:
  - projects which accept estimates are guesses and work with them anyway
  - kanban / pull-queue

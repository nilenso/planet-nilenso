# On bus factors

- graph examples - bad case vs good case
- smells to detect bus factors
- antipatterns
- solutions that we've used
- how to open connections

# intro
- what is "bus factor" (guido story): http://legacy.python.org/search/hypermail/python-1994q2/1040.html
- we are not talking about succession planning, but connections -- communication channels
- steve jobs was hard to replace (and wasn't replaced)
    - guido and rich hickey will be hard to replace
    - out goal would be to eliminate special-ness
- we've tried viewing communication channels as a neural network; it helps visualize the potential failures

# graph examples (good v. bad)
- gifs

# Examples of our own
- taking sales calls: not enough people have built the skill
- gh: lost sale due to weak connections
- gs: connection with the rest of the team wasn't very strong.
- operations projects: renting the new office? (cc'ing business)
- Interviewing for admin position?
- Hiring V: we lost a potential hire because someone left the company
- fear of loss:
    - Who leaving but we'll still communicate the opportunity/connection
    - sales leads we hand over to MH

# Antipatterns and smells
- Skipping a learning step (pairing on sales calls -- going straight to driving)
- "The Sales Guy"
- "The Conference Attendee"
- if you can't imagine/handle someone taking a month off (family/health issues)
- "the pending reply"
- a meeting / visit on hold
- only one person can CP / sign contracts
- you are afraid of losing sales and/or people
- you have schemes to hide information

# solutions (how)
## Openning connections
- intro email
- context conversation
    - more context = more value
- make external people comfortable
    - pushing external people to talk to the group (cc: business@nilenso)
- drawing the graph by hand or generating the graph would be fun
- compares weights to prioritize
- hiring

## Skill-building
- shadow, pair, drive
    - health insurance
	- project management (CP)
	- presentations
	- HR

### Examples
- lawyer (qt contract)
- kitty & jithu (audio/greenery)
- steve & nid - lawyer (khaitan)
- T CPing his own project
- kitty, srihari, nid, tim presenting for the first time (at rubyconf)
- neena presenting at construct
